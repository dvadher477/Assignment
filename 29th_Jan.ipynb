        "\n",
        "2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python supports OOP, allowing you to define classes and create objects. It promotes the use of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure and organize code. This paradigm helps in creating reusable and modular code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming principles, where you use functions as first-class objects. You can pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and use higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce. Python also supports anonymous functions using lambda.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Procedural Programming: This is a subset of imperative programming where the focus is on procedures or functions. Python allows you to organize code into reusable functions and modules, facilitating structured programming.\n",

        "5. Reflective Programming: Python has reflection capabilities, allowing you to inspect and modify the program structure at runtime. This includes using functions like getattr, setattr, and introspection tools to examine objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Declarative Programming: Although not as central as other paradigms, Python can support declarative programming to some extent, especially through its use of libraries that implement declarative approaches, such as SQLAlchemy for database interaction."
